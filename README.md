# Rock Paper Scissors
This project is a simple HTML-based Rock Paper Scissors game. It allows users to play against the computer by clicking on buttons representing rock, paper or scissors. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript.

## Features

Rock: Allows the user to choose rock.

Paper: Allows the user to choose paper.

Scissors: Allows the user to choose scissors.

The computer randomly selects its move (rock, paper or scissors).

The game determines the winner based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules.

An alert is displayed showing the user's choice, the computer's choice and the result of the game (win, lose or tie).

## Code Overview

The application uses basic HTML for the structure and JavaScript for the game logic. The play function is called when the user clicks on one of the buttons. It generates a random move for the computer and compares it with the user's choice to determine the winner. The game logic is implemented using conditional statements to check the combinations of moves and determine the result.
